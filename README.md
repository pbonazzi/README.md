👋🏻 I am a Machine Learning Research Scientist, Engineer at ETH Zurich. 
With a strong background on Statistics and half a decade of experience in training models. 

🔥 Currently, I'm working on Efficient Machine Learning (QAT, Spiking Neuron Networks, Hardware-Aware  Network Design). 
To this end, I interface a lot with hardware especially with Neuromorphic Chips (Sinabs, Lava, etc.) , GPUs (OpenCL, Trition, etc.), ASICs (IMX500, Coral, etc.) and FPGAs (Verilog). 

⏳ Previously, I worked on diffusion models, differentiable rendering, vision-language model to reconstruct and de-noise 3D point clouds from images. 
I also worked on conditional 3D scene generation architectures from scene graphs and designed my own graph transformer from scratch (back in 2021).

❤️ Passions : AI, walking, public speaking.
